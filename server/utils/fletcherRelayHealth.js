/**
 * Fletcher relay-health verdict (#1165 follow-up).
 *
 * The original probe marked fletcher degraded whenever the newest relay
 * outcome was an error inside a 10-minute window. Fletcher is a passive
 * relay with no background refresh, so after ONE transient upstream
 * timeout there is often no follow-up fetch to clear the error — health
 * sat degraded until the window expired, and watchtower paged Discord on
 * both flips. One failed HTTP request bought two pings, every time.
 *
 * Now a relay error only degrades health once fletcher reports at least
 * CONSECUTIVE_FAILS_THRESHOLD consecutive failures. A genuinely blocked
 * upstream (the v26.6.0 release-day serial 403s) still trips immediately
 * as retries stack up; a lone blip reports ok with the blip noted in the
 * detail string so the information isn't lost, it just doesn't page.
