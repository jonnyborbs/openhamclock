# OpenHamClock

**A real-time amateur radio dashboard for the modern operator.**

OpenHamClock brings DX cluster spots, space weather, propagation predictions, POTA/SOTA/WWFF/WWBOTA activations, PSKReporter, satellite tracking, WSJT-X integration, direct rig control, an in-browser logbook, and a full emergency-communications mode into a single browser-based interface. Run it locally on a Raspberry Pi, on your desktop, in Docker, or just use the hosted site.

**☕ Support the Project:** [buymeacoffee.com/k0cjh](https://buymeacoffee.com/k0cjh) — Running [openhamclock.com](https://openhamclock.com) comes with real hosting costs including network egress, memory, CPU, and the time spent maintaining and improving the project. There is absolutely no obligation to donate — OpenHamClock is and always will be free. But if you find it useful and want to chip in, your donations are greatly appreciated and go directly toward keeping the site running and funding future development.

**🔧 Get Involved:** This is an open-source project and the amateur radio community is encouraged to dig into the code, fork it, and build the features you want to see. Whether it's a new panel, a data source integration, or a bug fix — PRs are welcome. See [Contributing](#contributing) below.

## Feature Highlights

- **Interactive world map** in three projections — flat (Mercator), azimuthal-equidistant centered on your QTH, and a full 3D globe with real satellite models — with a dozen basemap styles and ~28 toggleable overlay layers (gray line, aurora, MUF, D-RAP, lightning, satellites, RBN, WSPR, Maidenhead grid, CQ/ITU zones, aircraft, and more), most with single-key shortcuts.
- **DX cluster spots** from OpenHamClock's own cluster node (RBN + HamQTH + POTA/SOTA/WWFF + user spots, deduplicated), with band/mode/zone/watchlist filtering, worked-before and dupe badges from your log, click-to-tune, and click-to-listen via the nearest live KiwiSDR.
- **Activations** — live POTA, SOTA, WWFF, and WWBOTA activator panels with map markers.
- **Native logbook** — QSOs stored in your browser (IndexedDB), ADIF import/export, log-from-spot, and worked-before integration across all spot panels.
- **Propagation** — browser-side ITU-R P.533-14 (VOACAP-class) predictions via WebAssembly, point-to-point reliability charts, world heatmap, MUF map, band conditions, and ionosonde-corrected real-time data.
- **Space weather** — SFI/Kp/SSN with history, GOES X-ray flux, NOAA SWPC alerts, aurora forecast, solar imagery, lunar phase.
- **Satellite tracking** — SGP4 tracking of amateur satellites from CelesTrak/AMSAT/SatNOGS (optionally Space-Track), orbit tracks, footprints, pass info, and 3D models on the globe.
- **Rig control** — click any spot and your radio tunes, via the [Rig Bridge](rig-bridge/README.md) (Yaesu, Kenwood, Icom, Elecraft, FlexRadio, flrig, rigctld, and more) with a cloud relay for hosted use.
- **Digital modes** — WSJT-X/JTDX decodes on the map (UDP or cloud relay), JS8Call/MSHV control, PSKReporter TX/RX reports in real time.
- **Contest tools** — contest calendar, N1MM+/DXLog QSOs plotted live on the map, band plan overlay on the rig display.
- **EmComm layout** — ARES/RACES dashboard with APRS (internet + RF via local TNC), net roster, point-to-point messaging, resource token aggregation, telemetry dashboards, NWS alerts, FEMA shelters and disaster declarations, Winlink gateways and Pat client.
- **Meshtastic & MeshCom** — mesh network nodes and messages on the map and in dockable panels.
- **Works your way** — dockable drag-anywhere layout, Classic (original HamClock style), and EmComm layouts; five themes including a custom theme editor; named profiles; 16 languages; PWA offline mode with cached data.

## Quick Start

**Just want to use it?** Open **[openhamclock.com](https://openhamclock.com)**, set your callsign and grid, done.

**Self-host with Docker:**

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name openhamclock ghcr.io/accius/openhamclock:latest
```

**Self-host from source** (Node.js 22 LTS recommended):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/accius/openhamclock.git
cd openhamclock
npm ci
npm start
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. A setup wizard walks you through callsign and grid on first run.

**One-line installers** for Linux/macOS (`scripts/setup.sh`), Raspberry Pi kiosk (`scripts/setup-pi.sh`), and Windows (`scripts/setup-windows.ps1`) — full commands and per-platform details in the **[Quick Start guide](docs/QUICKSTART.md)**.

For development with hot reload:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Backend (http://localhost:3001)
node server.js

# Terminal 2 — Frontend (hot reload on http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev
```

**Hardware:** the server side is light (~100–150 MB RAM); it's the browser rendering the map that works a machine. A Pi 4 (2 GB+) or Pi 5 makes a smooth kiosk; a Pi 3B+ is best as a headless server or with Low Memory Mode enabled in Settings. The 3D globe wants WebGL — without it the app falls back to the flat map automatically.

## Configuration

All configuration lives in `.env` (auto-created from `.env.example` on first run) — and almost everything can also be changed in the in-app Settings panel, which takes priority. The only two lines most people touch:

```bash
CALLSIGN=K0CJH
LOCATOR=EN10
```

> Files starting with a dot are hidden by default — `ls -la` in a terminal, `Ctrl+H` in a Linux file manager, `Cmd+Shift+.` in macOS Finder.

**Settings priority:** browser Settings panel (localStorage) → `.env` → built-in defaults. Your `.env` is never overwritten by updates. Self-hosted single-operator installs can set `SETTINGS_SYNC=true` to store UI settings on the server so every device gets the same setup.

### Common variables

The complete annotated list lives in [`.env.example`](.env.example). Highlights:

## API Overview

The backend exposes a JSON REST API under `/api`, heavily cached server-side to be kind to upstream services. Notable endpoints:

| Endpoint                                                                                        | Description                                                                                            |

## Architecture

React 18 + Vite frontend, Express backend. The backend is an API proxy and data aggregator — external calls are cached server-side so any number of browsers add near-zero upstream load. Real-time data flows over SSE (DX cluster, PSKReporter, RBN), UDP (WSJT-X, N1MM), and a server-side MQTT proxy.

## Updating

- **Hosted site** — nothing to do; a toast appears when a new version deploys.
- **Git installs** — `./scripts/update.sh` (Linux/macOS/Pi) or `.\scripts\update.ps1` (Windows), then restart. Local installs also get an **UPDATE** button in the header. Optional auto-update via `AUTO_UPDATE_ENABLED=true`.
- **Docker** — `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.
- **Railway** — push to the connected repo, or `railway up`.

The update scripts back up `.env`, pull, rebuild, and restore `.env` — your configuration is never lost.

## FAQ

**Do I need a license to use OpenHamClock?** No — it's a receive-only dashboard. A callsign makes PSKReporter "my signal" views and cluster login meaningful, but anyone can watch spots and space weather.

**Can multiple people use one server?** Yes. Each browser keeps its own settings, filters, and DX target; the server cache means extra users add no upstream load. Shared-station operators can use **Profiles** (Settings → Profiles) to switch setups.

**Why don't I see DX spots / PSK reports?** Make sure your callsign is set. PSKReporter falls back from the live stream to HTTP automatically; check the panel footer for the active method. For clusters, check the server console and any custom `DXSPIDER_PROXY_URL`.

**Emoji show as boxes on Linux/Pi?** Install a color emoji font on the machine running the _browser_: `sudo apt install fonts-noto-color-emoji`, then restart the browser. The Pi setup script does this automatically.

**Where's the `.env` file?** In the repo root, hidden by the leading dot — `ls -la` shows it. Run `npm start` once and it's created from `.env.example` automatically.

More Q&A throughout the **[User Manual](docs/MANUAL.md)**.

## Monitoring

OpenHamClock exposes a Prometheus-compatible endpoint at `/metrics` (optionally protected with `METRICS_AUTH_KEY` as a bearer token) and a human-friendly health dashboard at `/api/health`.
